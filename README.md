# Calculator

## Overview

This C++ program provides a variety of mathematical operations including basic arithmetic, exponentiation, logarithms, solving quadratic equations, and applying the sine and cosine rules. Additionally, it can calculate the area of a triangle based on user input.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- **Exponentiation**: Compute base raised to an exponent.
- **Logarithms**: Compute the logarithm of a number.
- **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Find the roots of a quadratic equation.
- **Sine Rule**: Calculate unknown sides or angles in a triangle using the sine rule.
- **Cosine Rule**: Calculate unknown sides or angles in a triangle using the cosine rule.
- **Area of Triangle**: Calculate the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, you can use `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
2. **Run the Program**
   ```sh
    ./calculator

## Notes
* Make sure to enter valid numerical values when prompted.
* For logarithmic calculations, the base e (approximately 2.71828) is used if not specified.
* Angle values should be entered in degrees.
